All python functions for one assignment are gathered in one file: assignment1.py, assignment2.py, etc. Data files are identical to original Octave assignments and are in *.mat format.

Python packages in use:
* numpy for vector and matrix operations;
* scipy.io for loading *.mat files to Python;
* matplotlib for drawing plots.

PS The course is really good.
